   CLOSED: [2016-08-05 Fri 10:09]
   - Note taken on [2016-08-05 Fri 10:09] \\
     Created two live USB stick, for clonezilla and gparted.

     Clonezilla is used to clone all the data from the source hard drive (4TB) to the
     target hard drive (10TB) which will automatically be partitioned into a 4TB
     partition.

     Then Gparted is used to resize the target hard drive from 4TB back to 10TB.
     - SwapOff "Linux-swap" partition. Actually not needed, since we booted from
       gparted live usb and this partition was was not mounted at the first place.
     - Delete "Linux-swap" partition. Now you will have a pretty big unallocated
       partition.
     - Apply operation.
     - Create a new "Linux-swap" partition at the end of the hard drive. SWAP = 2 *
       RAM.
     - Apply operation.
     - Resize/extend the "data" partition all the way to the rest unallocated
       partition.
     - Apply operation.

     With new test bench, running 12H BurnInTest is fine. But still I would like to
     try more rounds before we can conclude that BurnInTest is fully functional.
     And if that is the case, maybe we could change back to the old manner. Even Jens
     does not think it is really necessary.

     It complains about mongoose cannot be started on port 80.
     My current understanding about mongoose is that it is a simple webserver.
     But what does it do for test board test?
     I need to find out in the coming week or so.
